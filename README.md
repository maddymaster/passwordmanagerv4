# passwordmanagerv4
This isa nodeJS application of a basic password manager. In version 4 I have implemented error handling and explored nodejs. Version 1 is very basic, v2 has validation to input included, V3 has Json and encrypting password included and V4 of the password manager has error handling. I have incrementally explored different features of node to help beginners in node build their own apps and learn iterative development. Fire this application by cd into the directory, do a npm install if you do not have the dependencies installed. it wont harm if you already do and are in doubt and then fire the app using 'node app.js' or 'npm start' . Note that there is no DB connection, this saves everything locally
